# changeBgColor
 A few lines of code that changes the background color of a page each time the button on the page is clicked. The colors are selected from a pre-specified array of colors.
 There is also a code that handles a 'keypress' event. This codes alerts the key you pressed on your PC each time you press. 
 This is one of my very early projects when I started learning. I decided not t create a separate script/style file sice the lines of code are few.
